## Work Plan (About 1 ~ 1,5 months): <a id = "work-plan"></a>

![Work Plan Diagram](./images/CS115_Assignment_workPlan.drawio.svg)

There are 4 Phases:
### Phase 1: Learn LDA & QDA basis and make some experiment with it (about 4 weeks ~ 1 month): <a id = "phase-one"></a>
Note: In this Phase, we do it by seperated individuals. Then in the next phase, we meets and teach each others.

#### Conceptuals - Learning Basis <a id = "phase-one-conceptuals"></a>
- Explore resources and pin it to the Documents area.
- Try to learn it from 3 perspectives:
    - Calculus
    - Linear Algebra 
    - Probability

#### Experiments - Making Experiment with learnt knowledge <a id = "phase-one-experiment"></a>
**Please, do the code from scratch**

- Do it with some datasets, probably from ISLP library 
- Make plots to make people understand the insight of LDQ and QDA.

### Phase 2: Gathering Resources for the slide show (3 days): <a id = "phase-two"></a>

- Meets and argue about the first Phase.
- Gathers resources, including plots, dataset visualizations, model predictions to reveal the insights.

### Phase 3: Learn Beamer Latex and Get the slides going (4 days): <a id = "phase-three"></a>

- Learn Beamer Latex
- Prepare the Slides from the content got from Phase 2

### Phase 4: Prepare for the Presentation (1 week): <a id = "phase-four"></a>

- Prepare side information about LDA and QDA
- Learn by heart the script or figure out somewhat to present without any hesitation

## Notes: <a id = "notes"></a>
This tracks the progress of the group.

## Documents: <a id = "documents"></a>
